Newest First Playlist

cat *.m3u | grep ^Podcasts | sed 's.Podcasts/.TF1:Podcasts\\.g' | sed 's./.\\.g' | tac > Newest\ First.m3u


### Explanations

# cat *.m3u
## Lists all the contents of .m3u files. This may be huge, I only have ~500 episodes so it works fine.

# grep ^Podcasts
### Just grabs all the lines starting with Podcasts, so none of the EXTINFO stuff.

# sed 's.Podcasts/.TF1:Podcasts\\.g'
## Replaces all the "Podcasts/" of the just-grabbed files and replaces it with "TF1:Podcasts\". My AGPTEK 02 will not "Find" any files unless the file hierarchy starts with TF1. I'm assuming that's the internal flash memory, but I don't know.

# tac
## Reverses the order so now they're sorted by Newest First :)

# > Newest\ First.m3u
##P Places all the stuff into a new playlist called (quite creatively) "Newest First"
