Newest First Playlist

cat *.m3u | grep ^Podcasts | sed 's.Podcasts/.TF1:Podcasts\\.g' | sed 's./.\\.g' | tac > Newest\ First.m3u


### Explanations

# cat *.m3u
## Lists all the contents of .m3u files. This may be huge, I only have ~500 episodes so it works fine.

# grep ^Podcasts
### Just grabs all the lines starting with Podcasts, so none of the EXTINFO stuff.

# sed 's.Podcasts/.TF1:Podcasts\\.g'
## Replaces all the "Podcasts/" of the just-grabbed files and replaces it with "TF1:Podcasts\". My AGPTEK 02 will not "Find" any files unless the file hierarchy starts with TF1. I'm assuming that's the internal flash memory, but I don't know.

# tac
## Reverses the order so now they're sorted by Newest First :)

# > Newest\ First.m3u
##P Places all the stuff into a new playlist called (quite creatively) "Newest First"


### TO-DO:
## Re-create the Playlists
    ## Maybe ask interactively if they needed to be sorted by Newest First? If Y, then TAC
## Delete original Files?
## Instead of CATing a giant amount of lines, place into text file first? Might be an issue for people with tens of thousands of episodes.


Makes a copy of each file for backup purposes :)
for f in *; do cp "$f" "$f.BKP"; done


c[_] -> cat 2.5\ Admins.m3u | grep /202* | sort -r > test.txt
Does a reverse sort (Aggregate, then sort & reverse sort for oldest and newest first?)
